## 🔧 How to use
<!--Create a directory called `output` in the same one as everything else.
-->
👉 Run the following command:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

👉 Then, put your proxies in 📁 `data/proxies.txt`, and add your API key in 📁 `data/config.json` for the captcha solving API you wish to use.

👉 You can also configure the thread count, the 📩 server invite, username mode, etc.
