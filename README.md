An open-source Discord member booster written in Python.

## How to use
<!--Create a directory called `output` in the same one as everything else.
-->
Run the following command:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then, put your proxies in `data/proxies.txt`, and add your API key in `data/config.json` for the captcha solving API you wish to use.

Also configure the thread count, the server invite, username mode, etc.
